This is a [TextMate bundle][] for the [BEATS Drum Machine language][BEATS].  You'll need to download and install BEATS before you get any use out of this bundle.  Right now the language grammar is a clone of the YAML bundle, but we could potentially add syntax highlighting or other features.  Furthermore, you can hit âŒ˜R to play your audio file using the `afplay` command.
